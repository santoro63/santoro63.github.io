* About This Repository

This repo is for my Github pages presence, where I hope to share blogs about my different technology adventures.
Since I am an Emacs fanboy, the goal is to see how much we can do via Emacs and org-mode.

* Tooling

To build this site we use:
+ Emacs (of course!)
+ org-mode 
+ (G)Make

For development support we use:
+ python 3 (and http.server) to run a local static-file serving server


* Building

Most common commands are:
+ =make build= creates the website and puts it in the [[./docs][docs]] subdirectory
+ =make clean= cleans everything up
+ =make help= gives you a list of available build commands


* Directory Structure

| Directory | Description                                                             |
|-----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| src       | All files that make up the website go here                              |
| docs      | Where the generated website is placed (and where github wants it to be) |
